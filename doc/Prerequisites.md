# Prerequisites:

- ant 1.9.6 or above with ant-contrib (1.0b2 or above)
- git 2.11.4 or above
- make 4.1 or above
- perl 5.10.1 or above\*\*
- curl 7.20.0 or above (needs -J/--remote-header-name support)
- docker (needed if you wish to run docker-based third-party application tests in the /external directory)

Note for Windows testing, cygwin is also required.

## Detailed installation instructions

# install ant 1.9.6 or above with ant-contrib (1.0b2 or above) following the following steps :

- Visit the `http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/ `
- From there visit `https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi` to download any binary listed out there.
- I would suggest installing ant manually. Follow this article `https://girishkr.medium.com/install-apache-ant-1-10-on-ubuntu-16-04-7e249765e1bc` for a proper guide if you are on Ubuntu. Remember that if you are not familiar with vim you might replace the sudo vim /etc/profile.d/ant.sh with sudo nano /etc/profile.d/ant.sh. It gives an easy to understand interface.
- For any other OS you might be using, refer to `https://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html`

  - Assume Ant is installed in c:\ant\. The following sets up the environment:

  set ANT_HOME=c:\ant
  set JAVA_HOME=c:\jdk11.0.8_10
  set PATH=%PATH%;%ANT_HOME%\bin

- To check whether you have installed Ant properly or not, you may run the command `ant`. You should get the following output:
  Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
  Build failed
- If you don't get this then you may log out and log in into your system again to check if you got it right!

# Installing ant-contrib 1.03b or above

- Visit `https://sourceforge.net/projects/ant-contrib/files/`
